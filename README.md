##Setup flutter frontend

*Prerequisites

Flutter SDK: Download and install the Flutter SDK from the official Flutter website. Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system: Flutter Installation Guide

Dart SDK: Flutter relies on the Dart programming language. The Flutter SDK includes the Dart SDK, but if you already have Dart installed, make sure it is the latest stable version.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can use any text editor or IDE for Flutter development, but the recommended IDE is Visual Studio Code with the Flutter and Dart plugins installed. Alternatively, you can use Android Studio with the Flutter plugin.

Android Emulator or iOS Simulator: To run and test your Flutter application, you will need either an Android emulator or an iOS simulator. Make sure you have set up the emulator or simulator of your choice before proceeding.

##Setting up the Flutter Project


Clone or download the project repository from a version control system (e.g., GitHub) or create a new project using the Flutter CLI command: flutter create project_name.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

Run the command flutter pub get to fetch and install the project dependencies. This command will download the necessary packages and libraries specified in the pubspec.yaml file.

Connect your physical device or start the Android emulator/iOS simulator.

To verify that Flutter is set up correctly and devices are connected, run the command flutter devices. It will display the list of connected devices.

Run the command flutter run to launch the application on the connected device or emulator. If you have multiple devices connected, use the flutter run -d device_id command, where device_id is the identifier of the target device.

Wait for the application to build and launch on the selected device. The first build may take a while, but subsequent builds will be faster.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up and launched the project
